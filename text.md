One of the issues I ran in to with trying to be mindful in the office is that most meditation apps/exercises require you to close your eyes or listen to calming music. This can be pretty embarrassing if someone doesn't know what you're doing (and look like your slacking off on the job). I love that your suggestions don't include any of that and can be done without anyone knowing what you're up to. 

If you're interested, I made an app that focuses on breathing and being aware and can be done while taking a walk. I don't get in to thinking about the words being used, but maybe I should. That's a really good idea.

Anyway, here are the links:

Would love feedback, even negative!

One of the issues I ran in to with trying to be mindful is that most meditation apps/exercises require you to close your eyes or listen to calming music. Any parent knows that can be pretty tough with kids around. 

To help with that, I made an app that doesn't require solitude or quiet and can be done even while watching the kids. The idea is to fit mindfulness in to your life, not to fit your life around mindfulness.

I'm a parent of two young kids and have trouble fitting in meditation due to long hectic days. I had the idea to build an app/website where you go through mindfulness exercises that don't require a quiet room or being alone (something you don't get much of with kids around).

I'm looking for feedback on it and was hoping you could take a few minutes to give it a try. The thing I need the most help with right now is making sure the prompts/exercises are good. As someone who has limited experience with mindfulness, I'm not entirely confident I got the exercises right.

Right now you can go through the exercises for free at http://busymindapp.com, or you can check out the Android app on the Play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.bescape550966 or the iOS store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/busymind-mindfulness-meditation/id979420569?ls=1&mt=8

Thanks!
